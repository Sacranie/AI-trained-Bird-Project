# AI-trained-Bird-Project

This project utilises deep learning to train an AI model for recognizing different species of birds from images. The AI model is designed to classify bird images into six categories: Sparrow, Pigeon, Crow, Robin, Cassowary, and Emu. The entire workflow, from data collection to prediction, is automated using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other libraries.
